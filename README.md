## Thank you for accepting Flocabulary's UI/UX/CSS challenge!

At Flocabulary, we strive to provide rich educational materials that are also elegant, intuitive
web interfaces. In this challenge you'll help create a hypothetical
feature that's very similar to mad libs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs ).
It won't be highly educational, but with your help, it'll at least have a good UI.

Here's a live hosted demo of this functionality: https://flocabulary.github.io/madlibs-ui-challenge/

It's functional, but it clearly needs some styling and finessing. In your work, feel free
to use our style guide https://www.flocabulary.com/tools/ui-style-guide/ but you are not
bound to it. You can alter or remove any static text. Usage of modern CSS features like `transition`, `animation`
and `flex-box` is encouraged. This exercise may require you to use some `git`, but you are not being
judged on your use of it. 

### If you have Node.js installed on your computer, or foresee no problem getting it installed, follow these directions (otherwise scroll down):
0. install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
1. Fork this repo https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
2. Clone forked repo to local folder
3. In same directory as `package.json`, run `npm install`
4. To start development server, run `npm start`. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server
5. Add/change CSS in `styles/App.css`. If you would like to use a preprocessor, create a new file in `styles/` with the suffix of your choice and require it in `Main.js`
6. Alter markup in `Main.js`, `MadlibForm.js` and `SubmittedMadlib.js` in the `components/` folder. We use React's `jsx` syntax to generate HTML. It can generally by altered like HTML, with some differences that are noted in comments. More info: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html
7. To submit your challenge push your updates to your forked repo

This is definitely the preferred option. Please feel free to reach out if you
have any questions at all about getting this up and running. I'm happy
spending a little time on the phone if necessary

### If you cannot install Node.js (the lo-fi option)
1. Fork this repo https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
2. Clone forked repo to local folder
3. Run `git checkout gh-pages`
4. Prepare styles in new file `styles/App.css` and link it in `index.html`.
5. Push updated gh-pages branch to github

**or**

1. Download `gh-pages` branch as zip file https://github.com/flocabulary/madlibs-ui-challenge/archive/gh-pages.zip
2. Prepare styles in new file `styles/App.css` and link it in `index.html`.
3. Submit your work as a .zip file in an email.

Unfortunately this option means using CSS only.
